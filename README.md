Learning to build a chat application with the MERN stack

For this project, I wanted to build a full-stack chat application to better learn JavaScript and specifically to learn more about React (a technology I've not used before). I will be using a tutorial found on YouTube as a guide for this project, the URL for the tutorial is:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02MoKBaU3SY&list=PLKhlp2qtUcSZsGkxAdgnPcHioRr-4guZf&index=2
